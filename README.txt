Tax Buddy is an idea that I just came up with a couple of days ago.
My boss had asked me to add the total amount that our business had made in each
state over the last year. I figured instead of counting each individual job, I would
design a program that did it for me. Functionality for all 50 states is not currently available.
Also with being a brand new program, there are sure to be some kinks that need to be worked out.
Will continue to update the project moving forward.
